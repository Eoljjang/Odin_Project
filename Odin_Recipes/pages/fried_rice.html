    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Curated in the homes of many Asian households, fried rice is a given staple for many familes and individuals. It's a great way 
        to get in lots of macro-nutrients while maintaining a great budget-friendly price and easy accessibility. Below is the steps to create my favourite version of fried rice.

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Gather all ingredients and dice accordingly.</li>
        <li>Cook your meat in the pan first.</li>
        <li>Cook your vegetables in the pan next.</li>
        <li>Throw in your rice. Make a little opening and crack in an egg.</li>
        <li>Once the egg has firmed a little, break it up and mix it together with the rice.</li>
        <li>Add in a tablespoon of fish sauce, and 2 teaspoons of sesame oil.</li>
        <li>Mix well for 2 minutes - or until liking.</li>
        <li>Plate and serve.</li>
    </ol>
