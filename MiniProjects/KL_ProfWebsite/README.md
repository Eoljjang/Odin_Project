# Professor's Website: Biography
## Changes
Design Overhauls:
* Shifted focus more towards "about me" and a minimalist style.
* Color palette muted, and easier on the eyes. Goal of professionalism / ease of use. 
* Content focused in center of screen.
* Text is larger, easier to read, and easier to focus on. Important text "jumps out" more.
* Profile picture is centered on the screen.
* Contact information underneath pfp as icons. Clicking on them copies the relevant information with snackbar animation.
* External links added to bottom of page as a section.
* Most elements converted from in-line block to flexbox (allows for re-sizing & mobile device support).

Other Changes:
* Certain animations added in.
* Font is now "Varela Round".
* Removed some old logos.

Known Bugs:
* Fade animation on button link plays on first load of page (it shouldn't play at this time).
* Img overlaps "department" title when viewport is less than 540 px.
