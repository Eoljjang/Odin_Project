# Professor's Website: Biography
## Changes
Design Overhauls:
* Shifted focus more towards "about me" and a minimalist style.
* Color palette darker, and easier on the eyes. Goal of professionalism. 
* Content focused in center of screen.
* Text is larger, easier to read, and easier to focus on. Important text "jumps out" more.
* Profile picture is centered on the screen.
* Contact information underneath pfp as icons. Clicking on them copies the relevant information with snackbar animation.

Functional Changes:
* All elements converted from in-line block to flexbox (allows for re-sizing & more device support).
* Links to other locations are now inside the burger menu on the right hand side (pops-out).

Other Changes:
* Animations upon website load.
* Animations for burger menu.
* Added a footer where remaining logos go. 
* Font is now "Varela Round".
